# ASYMMETRIC DIFFERENTIAL LAYER
def Adl_2d(x):
    """
    Asymmetric Differential Layer (ADL) in 2D.
    
    Given a matrix IN of shape *[H, W]*, returns a matrix OUT of shape *[H , integer_part(W/2)]*.
    In short, The input matrix is folded in half along width dimension, 
    and the overlapped elements are subtracted beetween them.
    
    Parameters
    -----------------
    x : torch.Tensor
        The input matrix *IN* (size *HxW*)
        
    Returns
    -----------------
    torch.Tensor 
        ADL output matrix *OUT* (size *Hx(W/2)*).
        OUT(i, j) = IN(i, j) - IN(i, W + 1 - j).

    """
    Asymmetric Differential Layer (ADL) in 3D.
    
    Given a matrix IN of shape *[F, H, W]*, returns a matrix OUT of shape *[F, H , integer_part(W/2)]*.
    In short, The input matrix is folded in half along width dimension, 
    and the overlapped elements are subtracted beetween them.
    ADL in 3D is equivalent to perform ADL in 2D F times, one for HxW matrix in input.
    
    Parameters
    -----------------
    x : torch.Tensor
        The input matrix *IN* (size *FxHxW*)
        
    Returns
    -----------------
    torch.Tensor
